Hi everyone, This blog explores the new communication protocol, known as Matter which is being developed by <strong>Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA)</strong>
<br>
To know more, Let's go on a journey and explore the new generation of communication protocols.
<br>

  ## What's Matter?
  As the IoT market boomed. The popularity for smart home devices shot up. This resulted in a new market of Smart Home. Many companies joined hands and contributed to this boom by making Smart Devices.
  As there were a large number of devices, our general communication protocols such as Wifi, Bluetooth couldn't keep up. To provide a solution for this new protocols like Z-wave, emerged. But overtime they were also hit by the demand.
  This resulted in a huge wave of devices each having a different communication protocol, and requiring a hub to function.
  With time, a new revolution was long overdue. Google joined hands with Amazon, Apple, Zigbee Alliance together forming a new group known as CSA. To revolutionize the communication protocol.
  They sought to develop a unified solution. All the major companies that we know today, joined hands in this journey to build a unified solution for IoT devices.
  This was known as Project CHIP( COnnected Home Over IP). It evolved into what we know today as Matter.

  ## Why Matter should matter?
  As a consumer, Why should I even bother with Matter?. This was the question that was raised when Project CHIP was revealed in December 2019.
  Matter aims to unify all the communication standards that we know today, by using compatible smart home devices.
  But this option of switiching will be very expensive for me. Matter solves this problem by being compatible with current generation of smart home devices such as Google Home, Nest, Amazon Echo, Apple Homekit.
